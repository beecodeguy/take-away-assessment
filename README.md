# take-away-assessment

Thank you for your interest in the Frontend Developer position at our company. As part of our hiring process, we would like you to complete a take-home test to assess your skills in building a fully-functional frontend application using NextJs.

## Tools to use:
- NextJs (app router)
- shadcn/ui
- Typescript
- any charting library

## Instructions

For this assessmennt, we want you to create a simple application with two pages using NextJs. Requirements are stated as follows:

** Create a web application that displays a list of blog posts. Each blog post should have a title, author, and content. The application should have the following features:

### Pages:
- Create a homepage that displays a list of blog post titles. (you can show case your design here)
- Implement a dynamic route for individual blog posts. Clicking on a title should take the user to the corresponding blog post page.

  ** Fetch blog post data from a mock API or use a service like JSONPlaceholder (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) for sample data.

## Features
### Search Feature:
- Implement a search functionality that allows users to search for blog posts based on the title or author.
- Display search results dynamically as the user types.

### Charts:
Integrate a charting library (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js, or any other of your choice).
Create a chart that visualizes data related to the blog posts. For example, you could create a chart showing the distribution of posts by author.
** Or you may show the charts for any other random data from any `mock api` like `weather changes` `stock price changes` over time

### Additional Considerations:
Ensure a smooth user experience when using the search feature.
Customize the chart's appearance and make it responsive.

## Bonus
### Authentication
- Implement a basic authentication system. Users should be able to log in and view additional features, such as the ability to create and edit blog posts.

## Submission

- Please submit your code as a GitHub repository. The repository should contain a README.md file that explains how to start and deploy your application, as well as any other relevant information.
- Also, please deploy your solution to a free hosting platform of your choice and send us a test link. This is optional however, no evaluation point will be deducted if you don't deploy.

## Evaluation

We will evaluate your submission based on the following criteria:

- Code quality: Is the code well-structured, easy to read, and maintainable?
- Functionality: Does the application meet the requirements specified above?
- Aesthetics: Is the UI/UX appealing to users?
- Documentation: Is the code well-documented and easy to understand?
